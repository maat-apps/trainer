// purpose, for UI responsiveness. If a test ends (or calls
// vi.resetModules()) while one of those writes is still in-flight, the next
// test's beforeEach (resetIndexedDb() deleting the database) can close the
// connection out from under it, throwing an unhandled InvalidStateError that
// gets misattributed to whatever test happens to be running at that point. A
// trailing macrotask tick after every test gives any such write a chance to
// settle first.
