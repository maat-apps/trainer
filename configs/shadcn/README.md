# shadcn config

The `components.json` choice routines uses — the actual shareable unit for
shadcn-generated primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Select`, etc.), per
[maat-apps/maat-core#3](https://github.com/maat-apps/maat-core/issues/3):
generated files themselves aren't worth copying (they're meant to be
regenerated per repo via `npx shadcn add <component>`, and a copied file
drifts from what a fresh generate would produce), but the _config choice_
that decides what gets generated is worth keeping consistent.

## Usage

1. Copy `components.json` to your new repo's root.
2. Adjust `tailwind.css` (`"src/app/globals.css"`) if your repo's Tailwind
   entry point lives somewhere else — this path is routines' own layout,
   not universal.
3. Run `npx shadcn init` (it'll pick up the copied `components.json`) or
   just start running `npx shadcn add <component>` directly.
4. **Re-apply this one hand-patch after generating `button.tsx`**: the
   `outline` variant needs
   `disabled:bg-background/40 disabled:text-muted-foreground disabled:opacity-100 disabled:backdrop-blur-md`
   added to its class string (see routines' `src/components/ui/button.tsx`,
   or [`../../ui/button.tsx`](../../ui/button.tsx) in this repo, which
   already carries the patch). A fresh `npx shadcn add button` doesn't know
   about this — it's routines' own deliberate addition on top of the
   generated output, not something the shadcn registry ships.

## What this doesn't cover

- Design tokens (colors, true-black OLED background, fonts) — per-app
  product decisions, not part of the shadcn setup itself. See
  [`../../ui/README.md`](../../ui/README.md)'s own note on this.
- A registry/CLI step to automate steps 1–4 for a brand-new repo — that's
  [maat-apps/maat-core#7](https://github.com/maat-apps/maat-core/issues/7)
  (project scaffolding command), not this.
