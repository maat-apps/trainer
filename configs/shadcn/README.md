# shadcn config

The `components.json` choice routines uses — the actual shareable unit for
shadcn-generated primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Select`, etc.), per
[maat-apps/maat-core#3](https://github.com/maat-apps/maat-core/issues/3):
generated files themselves aren't worth copying (they're meant to be
regenerated per repo via `npx shadcn add <component>`, and a copied file
drifts from what a fresh generate would produce), but the _config choice_
that decides what gets generated is worth keeping consistent.

## Usage

Prefer installing [`@maat-apps/ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maat-apps/ui)
over regenerating `Button`/`Input`/`Select` yourself — it already ships the
hand-patched `button.tsx` below as a real dependency, so `npm update` gets
you fixes instead of a hand-patch to re-apply per repo (this is exactly
what trainer itself does — see `CLAUDE.md`'s Conventions section). The
steps below are only for a component `@maat-apps/ui` doesn't have (e.g.
`Textarea`, `Checkbox`), or a repo that deliberately wants to own a local,
customizable copy instead of depending on the package.

1. Copy `components.json` to your new repo's root.
2. Adjust `tailwind.css` (`"src/app/globals.css"`) if your repo's Tailwind
   entry point lives somewhere else — this path is routines' own layout,
   not universal.
3. Run `npx shadcn init` (it'll pick up the copied `components.json`) or
   just start running `npx shadcn add <component>` directly.
4. **Re-apply this one hand-patch after generating `button.tsx`**: the
   `outline` variant needs
   `disabled:bg-background/40 disabled:text-muted-foreground disabled:opacity-100 disabled:backdrop-blur-md`
   added to its class string (see
   [maat-core's `packages/ui/src/button.tsx`](https://github.com/maat-apps/maat-core/blob/main/packages/ui/src/button.tsx),
   which already carries the patch). A fresh `npx shadcn add button`
   doesn't know about this — it's routines' own deliberate addition on top
   of the generated output, not something the shadcn registry ships.

## What this doesn't cover

- Design tokens (colors, true-black OLED background, fonts) — per-app
  product decisions, not part of the shadcn setup itself. See
  [maat-core's `packages/ui/README.md`](https://github.com/maat-apps/maat-core/blob/main/packages/ui/README.md)'s
  own note on this.
- A registry/CLI step to automate steps 1–4 for a brand-new repo — that's
  [maat-apps/maat-core#7](https://github.com/maat-apps/maat-core/issues/7)
  (project scaffolding command), not this.
